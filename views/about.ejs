                    <p>When I don't have a guitar strapped over my shoulder, I spend alot of time developing solutions. Whether by automating in Excel with VBA, innovating in Access with forms, or pulling out all the stops with a full-featured web app, I
                        am always seeking elegant ways to mitigate the challenges that face a business or project.
                    </p>
                    <p>But let's back up a bit. My passion for development is more of a recent discovery. I don't have a computer science degree. I haven't been programming since I was young.
